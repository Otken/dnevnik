This library provides access to electronic diary, used at Moscow public schools.
The protocol and API is reverse-engineered using developer tools of Chrome browser.


www.gosuslugi.ru is referenced as PGU (Russian: портал государственных услуг)

To access diary you first need to authenticate via e-government service
www.gosuslugi.ru. Then, you need to select service "Access to electronic diary"
and enter credentials provided by teacher or diary administrator.
Access to diary is granted by teachers or diary administrators at schools.

The credentials will then be bookmarked in your PGU account. There is no obvious 
way to manage these bookmarks. You can have several credentials to access diary
bookmarked.

There are different levels of credentials:
- Student - granted to students. (I doubt though how an underage student can use PGU)
- Parent - granted to parents. Parents can supervise several students under one diary account.
- Teacher - granted to teachers.
- probably more, I do not have access to these roles.

Authorization takes several steps:

1. First, you authenticate at PGU
2. You select a bookmarked account to access specific account at E-Diary.

Under that account you can access to multiple students.

After selecting a student, you must select an academic year, e.g. "2016-2017"
